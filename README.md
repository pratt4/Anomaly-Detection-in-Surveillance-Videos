# Anomaly-Detection-in-Surveillance-Videos


This repository provides an implementation of anomaly detection in surveillance videos using the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithm. The dataset used is the UCF Crime Dataset, which contains various scenarios of criminal activities captured by surveillance cameras.

## Overview

Anomaly detection in surveillance videos is crucial for identifying abnormal activities. The MIL algorithm is employed in this project as it is suitable for learning from weakly labeled data. By training on the UCF Crime Dataset, the model can detect anomalies in unseen surveillance videos.

## UCF Crime Dataset

The UCF Crime Dataset consists of labeled videos depicting criminal activities. It is widely used for benchmarking anomaly detection algorithms in surveillance scenarios.
